# Variational LSTM with Pytorch
This repository is  based on the Salesforce code of [AWD-LSTM](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm/). 

There is no official PyTorch code for the Variational dropout to RNNs proposed by Gal and Ghahramani in the paper [A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in
Recurrent Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6241-a-theoretically-grounded-application-of-dropout-in-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf).
